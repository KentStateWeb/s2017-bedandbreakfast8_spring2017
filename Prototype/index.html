          Your Innkeepers, Louise and Darrell Johnson, have prepared every detail to ensure that your vacation is a special event that you will long remember. Your experience starts with a spacious room, a large comfortable bed, and a spectacular gourmet breakfast. Buckeye Bed & Breakfast is nestled in the foothills of the Cambridge park with 11 forested acres, beautiful landscaping and stunning views.

A three course gourmet breakfast is served at 8:00 am with a hot beverage and juice, homemade muffin/breakfast bread, in-season fresh fruit/berries, and an enticing entree. For the early riser your coffee or hot tea can be enjoyed while taking in the scenic view from the second story deck. With advanced notice we will try to accommodate any dietary restrictions. After your busy day, enjoy a complimentary evening snack and beverage to help you relax before bedtime.

On-site activities include evening campfires (on request), walking through our 11 acres of forested woodlands, star gazing, birding or relaxing on one of our porch swings. Enjoy edible landscaping in season, which include blueberry, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, apple and pear fruit trees.
