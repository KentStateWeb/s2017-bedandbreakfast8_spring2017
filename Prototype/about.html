<h2>History</h2>

Thank you for visiting our Ohio bed and breakfast’s website. We hope you carve out some time to visit Buckeye and experience its magic as we did.
Back in 1992, we came to this tranquil place in northern Ohio because we sorely needed a vacation. We couldn’t afford to go very far for our Ohio romantic getaway, and we didn’t have much time, so we decided to try the “Bed and Breakfast, Country Inn thing” that we heard some people talking about. We had never been to an inn before and didn’t know what to expect. That’s when the love affair began. We found, in this special place, people who genuinely cared about us — people who wanted to help us relax in this most tranquil environment.
Though this was our first inn experience, we were intrigued by the lifestyle and decided that innkeeping might be our next adventure. Well, as serendipity would have it, the innkeepers at the time were thinking about bringing on another couple to help them manage Buckeye Bed and Breakfast. It wasn’t long after, April of 1994 in fact, that we chose to abandon our former careers and join the Ohio Buckeye family. Then, on April 1st, 1997, after three years as Assistant Innkeepers, we proudly took ownership of Buckeye Bed & Breakfast. And to this day, we are still here, just about every hour of every day providing, along with our very able staff, what we like to call “traditional innkeeping” – an old-fashioned, very personal approach to hospitality.
There can be no greater love, warm and caring emotion, happiness and fulfillment than what we experience here each day. We thank those of you who trust in us enough to visit for the very first time; and to those of you who visit time and again, thank you for “filling our cup.”
Buckeye Bed and Breakfast is our home – and we dedicate our home to you providing warm and genuine hospitality unlike you have ever experienced. From heart and hand, we are here to pamper you in this most romantic and peaceful place.
Come join us and get to know why we call this place “a paradise for the senses, a vacation for the soul.”
Looking forward to hearing from you,



 We would like to thank you for providing hospitality and amenities that made our experience and stay here exceed our expectations. It was our perfect post-tax season romantic retreat (I am a tax accountant.) God bless and keep up the awesome job.
