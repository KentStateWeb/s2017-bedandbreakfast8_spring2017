  <p>We would like to thank you for providing hospitality and amenities that made
     our experience and stay here exceed our expectations. It was our perfect
     post-tax season romantic retreat (I am a tax accountant.) God bless and keep
     up the awesome job.
   </p>

    <h4>Ozzie and Marissa</h4>

  <p>Thank you for sharing this beautiful home, it is gorgeous. Love all the art,
     furniture and attention to details. Enjoyed the delicious food, especially
     cookies and banana bread. Most of all appreciate the relaxing atmosphere – ahhh.
     Will definitely share our stay with friends and family.

   <p>Thank you for a memorable anniversary! The room was beautiful, the breakfast
     delicious and the hospitality like none we had ever experienced. We very much
